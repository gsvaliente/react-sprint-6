# About

## What is needed

- Create three inputs that are of type checkbox
- When one of them is checked, add the value of each service
- If it is unchecked, remove from the total value
- Create a state with the total value to be shown at the bottom
- User can also add more PAGES and LANGS

## Things to consider

- Maybe use a state with all of the values at 0
- If one of them is checked, increase the price
- Then use this to calculate the total
